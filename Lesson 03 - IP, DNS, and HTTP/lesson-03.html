  <h1 id="lecture-1-fundamentals-of-ip-dns-and-http">Lecture 1:
  Fundamentals of IP, DNS, and HTTP</h1>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>This lecture covers three core technologies that make the web
  possible: IP addresses, DNS (Domain Name System), and HTTP (Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol). These technologies work together to enable every
  web interaction, from loading a simple webpage to streaming video
  content.</p>
  <h2 id="ip-addresses-the-internets-street-addresses">1. IP Addresses:
  The Internet’s Street Addresses</h2>
  <h3 id="what-are-ip-addresses">What are IP Addresses?</h3>
  <p>Just as physical addresses identify buildings, IP addresses
  identify devices on the internet. Every device needs a unique IP
  address to communicate with other devices. For example,
  <code>45.79.112.203</code> is an IP address that identifies a specific
  server on the internet.</p>
  <h3 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h3>
  <p>Let’s see IP addresses in action by connecting to
  <code>45.79.112.203</code>. This IP address is the server that runs <a
  href="https://tcpbin.com">tcpbin.com</a>, which is an echo service
  that returns any text you send to it. In a terminal, try running the
  following:</p>
  <pre><code>nc 45.79.112.203 4242</code></pre>
  <p>This will open a connection to the remote server. Type some text
  and hit “enter”; the text will be sent to tcpbin. Then, tcpbin will
  reply to you with the same text.</p>

  <h2 id="dns-the-internets-address-book">2. DNS: The Internet’s Address
  Book</h2>
  <p>While computers work with IP addresses, humans prefer memorable
  names. DNS translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com)
  into IP addresses (like 142.251.46.206). This translation happens
  automatically every time you visit a website.</p>

  </video>
  <h3 id="how-dns-works">How DNS Works</h3>
  <p>When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer
  contacts a “DNS recursive resolver” to find the corresponding IP
  address. The resolver follows a chain of several “authoratative
  nameservers.” For example, to resolve an IP address for
  <code>google.com</code>:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>A hardcoded <a
  href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers">root nameserver</a>
  responds with the IP of a nameserver authorized to resolve
  <code>.com</code> domains</li>
  <li>That nameserver responds with the IP of a nameserver authorized to
  resolve <code>google.com</code> domains</li>
  <li>That nameserver responds with the final IP address for
  <code>google.com</code></li>
  </ol>
  <video autoplay loop controls title="Animated diagram shows a client sending a DNS resolution request for &#39;google.com&#39;. The DNS recursive resolver then queries the root nameserver, .com nameserver, and google.com nameserver.">
  <source src="./lec01-dns-recursive.mp4" />
  </video>
  <h2 id="http-the-webs-spoken-language">3. HTTP: The Web’s Spoken
  Language</h2>
  <p>Once we have resolved the IP address of the server that we wish to
  talk to, we can request web pages, images, and other content from that
  server. However, we need to establish a standard language so that
  communicating machines can understand each other, even if they are run
  by different organizations and using different operating systems and
  browsers.</p>
  <p>HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) is a standard protocol that
  defines how web browsers and servers communicate. Proper HTTP
  communication is described by <a
  href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html">a lengthy
  specification</a>, but the core of the protocol is very simple to
  understand.</p>
  <h3 id="http-requests">HTTP requests</h3>
  <p>A basic HTTP request has a <em>request line</em>, one or more
  <em>request headers</em>, and then a blank line signalling the end of
  the request. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:133.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/133.0
Accept-Language: en-US,en
</code></pre>
  <p>The request line specifies:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods"><em>request
  method</em></a>, e.g. GET for fetching data or POST for uploading or
  modifying data</li>
  <li>A <em>URL path</em> indicating the resource we are requesting</li>
  <li>The HTTP protocol version</li>
  </ul>
  <figure>
  <img src="./http-request-line.jpeg"
  alt="Diagram breaking down the components of the request line" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Diagram breaking down the components of
  the request line</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header"><em>request
  headers</em></a> are used to indicate supplemental information about
  the request, such as which browser is being used, which
  language/locale is preferred, etc.</p>
  <h3 id="http-responses">HTTP responses</h3>
  <p>The server responds with a status line, headers, and content:</p>
  <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 03:48:35 GMT

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>The <em>response line</em> specifies:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The HTTP protocol version</li>
  <li>An HTTP <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status"><em>status</em></a></li>
  </ul>
  <figure>
  <img src="./http-response-line.jpeg"
  alt="Diagram breaking down the components of the response line" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Diagram breaking down the components of
  the response line</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Like request headers, the <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header"><em>response
  headers</em></a> contain metadata about the response.</p>
  <h3 id="observing-http-in-action">Observing HTTP in action</h3>
  <p>Most browsers include tools to view network traffic, such as <a
  href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network">Chrome’s
  DevTools</a>. You can use these tools to view the HTTP requests that
  your browser makes:</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="./chrome-dev-tools.png"
  alt="Screenshot of Chrome DevTools network panel" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot of Chrome DevTools network
  panel</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>You can also view the raw request and response by sending requests
  using the command-line utility <code>curl</code>:</p>
  <pre><code>$ curl -v https://www.google.com
&gt; GET / HTTP/2
&gt; Host: www.google.com
&gt; User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
&gt; Accept: */*

  <p>In fact, since HTTP is based on simple plain text, you can speak it
  to talk directly to servers yourself! Run
  <code>nc google.com 80</code> to open a connection to Google, and then
  type the following (be sure to hit enter <em>twice</em> at the
  end):</p>
  <pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
</code></pre>

  </video>
  <h3 id="key-characteristics-of-http">Key Characteristics of HTTP</h3>
  <p>In summary, HTTP is: - Simple: based on human-readable text -
  Extensible: can add new headers as needed - Transport agnostic:
  requires only reliable transport - Stateless: each request is
  independent - Servers maintain state through additional mechanisms
  like cookies - The protocol itself doesn’t track state between
  requests</p>
  <h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
  <p>Here’s how these technologies work together when loading a
  webpage:</p>
  <video autoplay loop controls title="Animated diagram illustrating the network requests involved in a full web page load">
  <source src="./lec01-all-together.mp4" />
  </video>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>DNS resolves the domain name to an IP address</li>
  <li>Your browser sends an HTTP request to that IP</li>
  <li>The server returns the HTML content</li>
  <li>Your browser requests additional resources (CSS, images,
  etc.)</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="web-protocol-security">Web protocol security</h2>
  <h3 id="dns-hijacking">DNS Hijacking</h3>
  <p>DNS hijacking occurs when attackers redirect DNS queries to
  malicious servers. For example, an attacker might seek to direct
  <code>bankofamerica.com</code> requests to an IP address under their
  control, instead of the real Bank of America server. There are several
  ways that this attack can happen:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><strong>Compromised DNS recursive resolvers or
  nameservers:</strong> When attackers gain control of DNS
  infrastructure, they can modify the responses sent to users.</li>
  <li><strong>Stolen DNS provider credentials:</strong> Attackers who
  obtain login credentials for DNS management accounts can modify the
  DNS records that the authoratative nameservers send.</li>
  <li><strong>Malware that changes local DNS settings:</strong> Some
  malware specifically targets DNS configuration on users’ local
  devices. By changing these settings, the malware causes infected
  devices to use attacker-controlled DNS recursive resolvers instead of
  the default recursive resolver.</li>
  <li><strong>Compromised routers:</strong> Home and office routers
  often serve as default DNS recursive resolvers for local networks. If
  attackers compromise a router, they can modify its DNS responses.</li>
  </ol>
  <video autoplay loop controls title="Animated diagram illustrating how a DNS hijacking attack works via a hijacked DNS resolver">
  <source src="./lec01-dns-hijacking.mp4" />
  </video>
  <p>Recent studies show the prevalence of these attacks:</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="./dns-attack-headline.png"
  alt="News article from CampusSafety with headline: “86% of Education Industry Experienced DNS Attack in Past Year”" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">News article from CampusSafety with
  headline: “86% of Education Industry Experienced DNS Attack in Past
  Year”</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>On the server side, DNS hijacking attacks are best mitigated using
  <a
  href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/">DNSSEC</a>.
  On the client side, using <a
  href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/">DNS
  over HTTPS</a> also helps to mitigate some forms of attack.</p>
  <h3 id="man-in-the-middle-attacks">Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h3>
  <p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly
  intercepts and potentially modifies communication between two parties
  who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</p>
  <p>There are several common ways MITM attacks can be executed:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><p><strong>Network eavesdropping:</strong> When users connect to
  public WiFi networks (like in coffee shops or airports), attackers on
  the same network can intercept unencrypted traffic between users and
  web servers.</p></li>
  <li><p><a
  href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/social-engineering/arp-spoofing/"><strong>ARP
  spoofing:</strong></a> Attackers can send fake Address Resolution
  Protocol (ARP) messages on a local network, tricking devices into
  sending traffic through the attacker’s machine instead of the
  legitimate router.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Evil twin attacks:</strong> Attackers set up rogue WiFi
  access points that mimic legitimate ones (e.g., “Starbucks_WiFi” vs
  the real “Starbucks WiFi”), hoping users will connect to their
  malicious network.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <figure>
  <img src="./man-in-the-middle.jpeg"
  alt="Diagram illustrating a man-in-the-middle attack" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Diagram illustrating a
  man-in-the-middle attack</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>HTTP is an <em>unencrypted</em> and <em>unauthenticated</em>
  protocol, so it offers no protections against MitM attacks. Once
  attackers have established themselves in the middle, they can:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Read sensitive information in unencrypted traffic (passwords,
  credit card numbers, etc.)</li>
  <li>Modify requests or responses to inject malicious content</li>
  <li>Capture authentication tokens or session cookies</li>
  <li>Present fake versions of websites to steal user credentials</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The best protection against MitM attacks is to use <a
  href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/">HTTPS/TLS</a>,
  which is an additional layer underneath HTTP that provides encryption
  and identity validation.</p>
