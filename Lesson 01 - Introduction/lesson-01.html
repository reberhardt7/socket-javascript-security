  <h2 id="security-can-be-fun">Security can be fun</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity is often portrayed as an advanced dark art, but when
  I started learning about it, I was surprised at how accessible it is
  if you simply bring a creative mindset and a willingness to think
  outside the box. You don’t need advanced programming knowledge or
  specialized tools; you just need to think critically about how systems
  are built, and think creatively about how they might break.</p>
  <p>Here are two stories from my early days of security exploration
  that show how fun and accessible security research can be:</p>
  <h3 id="bypassing-the-localstorage-limit">Bypassing the localStorage
  limit</h3>
  <p>While learning web development, I encountered the
  <code>localStorage</code> API, which allows websites to store up to 5
  MB of data in a user’s browser. The API is straightforward: it lets a
  site save small amounts of data in the browser for fast access.
  However, being in a security class at that time, I started to wonder:
  Is there a way to circumvent that 5 MB limit?</p>
  <p>The <code>localStorage</code> API works on the concept of an
  <strong>origin</strong>. In web security, an origin is defined as the
  combination of three components:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>The scheme (e.g., <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>).</li>
  <li>The hostname (e.g., <code>example.com</code>).</li>
  <li>The port (e.g., <code>80</code> for <code>http</code> or
  <code>443</code> for <code>https</code>).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>An origin is a way for browsers to determine whether two pieces of
  content come from the same source. For example:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>https://example.com</code> and
  <code>http://example.com</code> are <strong>different origins</strong>
  because their schemes differ.</li>
  <li><code>https://example.com</code> and
  <code>https://sub.example.com</code> are <strong>different
  origins</strong> because their hostnames differ.</li>
  <li><code>https://example.com:8080</code> and
  <code>https://example.com:443</code> are <strong>different
  origins</strong> because their ports differ.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The browser enforces security policies like the <strong>same-origin
  policy</strong>, which restricts how data can be accessed across
  origins. Similarly, the <code>localStorage</code> API applies its 5 MB
  limit per origin.</p>
  <p>I was curious: Would it be possible to set up a site that uses
  subdomains to create an infinite number of origins, each utilizing its
  full quota, to fill up a visitor’s entire hard drive?</p>
  <p>The web storage specification includes a safeguard against such
  abuse. It states:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>User agents should guard against sites storing data under the
  origins of affiliated sites, e.g., storing up to the limit in
  <code>a1.example.com</code>, <code>a2.example.com</code>,
  <code>a3.example.com</code>, etc., circumventing the main
  <code>example.com</code> storage limit.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, at the time, <strong>Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer
  did not implement this safeguard</strong>. Each subdomain was treated
  as a completely separate origin with separate quota, creating an
  opportunity to bypass the intended limits.</p>
  <p>By programmatically generating subdomains (e.g.,
  <code>1.example.com</code>, <code>2.example.com</code>,
  <code>3.example.com</code>, etc.) and using hidden iframes to load
  them, a malicious script could quickly fill the user’s hard drive. You
  can explore this concept at <a
  href="http://www.filldisk.com/"><code>filldisk.com</code></a>.</p>

  This attack was simple yet fun to execute, and it highlighted the
  impact of small implementation details. While this issue has since
  been fixed in all major browsers, it was a perfect example of how a
  security mindset can lead to significant findings.</p>
  <h3 id="clickjacking-with-invisible-frames">Clickjacking with
  invisible frames</h3>
  <p>Another interesting vulnerability I explored was a
  <strong>clickjacking attack</strong>. In one experiment, I created a
  game where users thought they were clicking a moving button on their
  screen. In reality, an invisible frame was positioned underneath the
  button, and the user’s clicks were being redirected to perform actions
  in the hidden frame, such as enabling their webcam without their
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>This attack was surprising to execute – by manipulating the visual
  elements of the web page, it was possible to trick users into actions
  they didn’t intend to perform.</p>
  <h2 id="security-can-be-scary">Security can be scary</h2>
  <p>The previous examples show how it can be fun to explore security
  even without much experience. However, security deficiencies can be
  scary if not taken seriously. Here are two cases of JavaScript
  security gone badly at scale.</p>
  <h3 id="british-airways-data-theft">British Airways data theft</h3>
  <p>In 2018, a <a
  href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/british-airways-data-theft-demonstrates-need-for-cross-site-scripting-restrictions/">flaw
  in the British Airways ticket purchase platform</a> allowed attackers
  to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This compromised
  the personal and financial information of approximately 380,000
  customers between August and September 2018. Attackers stole names,
  addresses, emails, and full credit card information in the attack.</p>
  <p>Following the attack, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office
  (ICO) issued a notice of intent to fine British Airways £183 million
  for infringements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  However, following appeals and discussions, the final penalty was £20
  million – still one of the largest GDPR-related fines issued in the UK
  at the time.</p>
  <h3 id="lottieplayer-crypto-drainer">LottiePlayer crypto drainer</h3>
  <p>In October 2024, a <a
  href="https://socket.dev/blog/supply-chain-attack-on-lottie-files-player">supply
  chain attack targeted</a> the <a
  href="https://lottiefiles.com/web-player">LottieFiles Player</a> npm
  package, which is used for embedding and playing animations on
  websites, with 52k weekly downloads at time of writing. The attacker
  leveraged a compromised npm token from a LottieFiles engineer,
  publishing several malicious versions of the package. This malicious
  code was then bundled into various legitimate websites using the
  library to display animations. When users visited these compromised
  websites, the library would display a prompt to connect a Web3 wallet,
  and would subsequently drain users’ funds.</p>
  <figure>

  alt="lottie-player crypto drainer prompt" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">lottie-player crypto drainer
  prompt</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>LottieFiles responded by revoking the compromised credentials and
  releasing an updated version (2.0.8) that removed the malicious
  payload. Although the malicious versions were quickly taken down from
  npm, we estimate that &gt;$1M USD was stolen from unsuspecting users
  by this attack.</p>
  <h2 id="why-is-web-security-hard">Why is web security hard?</h2>
  <p>Web browsers have extremely ambitious goals to accomplish:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Running untrusted code securely</strong>: The core
  challenge of web security lies in allowing users to run untrusted code
  safely in their browsers. This is no small feat; browsers blindly
  execute code from any website without exposing users to
  attack.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Mediating complex interactions between sites</strong>:
  Modern websites often combine content and functionality from multiple
  sources, known as “mashups.” For example, ads, analytics, and embedded
  widgets often run alongside a website’s code.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Increasingly low-level APIs</strong>: Users and
  developers demand increasingly powerful browser capabilities, pushing
  for APIs that interact directly with hardware or low-level system
  features, such as APIs for the camera, microphone, and GPU. While
  these features enable rich web applications, they expand the attack
  surface, making secure implementation more challenging.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Performance demands</strong>: Web applications demand
  high performance. Delivering performance often involves increased
  complexity.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>APIs not designed from first principles</strong>: The
  web was never designed with modern security needs in mind. It started
  as a platform for sharing simple documents but evolved into a complex
  application platform. As described in <em>Tangled Web</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that
  have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together.
  Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to
  browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security
  consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to
  confidently navigate this landscape.”</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Strict backwards compatibility requirements</strong>:
  The web operates under a “don’t break the web” philosophy, ensuring
  old websites remain functional indefinitely. Browsers cannot easily
  deprecate or remove features without risking compatibility issues.
  This commitment to compatibility makes improving security a slower,
  more difficult process.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>To reiterate, browsers aim to allow any site – even malicious ones
  – to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Download content from anywhere.</li>
  <li>Spawn worker processes.</li>
  <li>Open network connections to servers or other users’ browsers.</li>
  <li>Render media in numerous formats.</li>
  <li>Run code on the GPU.</li>
  <li>Save and read data from the local filesystem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This flexibility, while empowering for developers, is a significant
  challenge for secure implementation.</p>
  <p>Despite these challenges, the web has proven to be fairly robust.
  As noted by Ilya Grigorik, a Google web performance engineer:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“It’s all too easy to criticize, lament, and create paranoid
  scenarios about the ‘unsound security foundations’ of the web. Truth
  is, all of that criticism is true, and yet the web has proven to be an
  incredibly robust platform.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Although the web is one of the most attacked platforms, its
  iterative security improvements make it robust. However, building
  secure systems on this platform requires deliberate effort and a
  security-focused mindset, which we will practice developing through
  this course.</p>
  <h2 id="preview-of-the-class">Preview of the class</h2>
  <p>This course will systematically build your understanding of web
  security from the ground up:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Fundamentals (Lessons 1-3)</strong>: We’ll start by
  understanding the core technologies that power the web. You’ll learn
  about:
  <ul>
  <li>IP addresses and DNS: how computers talk to each other on the
  internet</li>
  <li>HTTP: the protocol that powers web communication</li>
  <li>HTML and JavaScript: the languages that create web
  experiences</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Core Security Mechanisms (Lessons 4-5)</strong>: We’ll
  explore the fundamental security boundaries in web browsers:
  <ul>
  <li>The Same-Origin Policy: how browsers isolate different websites
  from each other</li>
  <li>Cookies and Sessions: how websites maintain state and authenticate
  users</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Common Attack Patterns (Lessons 6-9)</strong>: We’ll
  examine major classes of web vulnerabilities:
  <ul>
  <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): tricking browsers into making
  unauthorized requests</li>
  <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): injecting malicious code into trusted
  websites</li>
  <li>SQL Injection and Command Injection: exploiting server-side code
  execution</li>
  <li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): manipulating server-side
  network requests</li>
  <li>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS): triggering
  exponential runtime in regular expression matching</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Supply Chain Security (Lesson 10)</strong>: Finally, we’ll
  look at how attackers target the dependencies that modern web
  applications rely on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By the end of this course, you’ll have both a theoretical
  foundation in web security and practical skills for building secure
  applications. More importantly, you’ll develop the security mindset
  needed to think critically about potential vulnerabilities and
  creative ways systems might be exploited.</p>
